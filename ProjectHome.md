Google Chrome Extension created to initiate searches of multiple craigslist cities using the same search parameters.

The extension allows users to save a set of defaults to do repeat searches of multiple cities. URLs are generated based on the user's input and a new tab is opened for each city specified to search. This extension was developed after my own need to regularly search a number of nearby craigslist cities for the same item.

Please Note: Searching a large number of ciites can result in spikes in CPU and Network usage, but shouldn't be much of a problem for any newer machine.

This is my first Google Chrome Extension, as well as my first time using Google Project Hosting so any tips are welcome!
